Drowsiness Detection 
Tags: Tensorflow,keras,numpy, OpenCV, Deepface, Matplotlib, os
I have built a drowsiness detection system using OpenCV, python
and Machine Learning. Deep Learning,Tensorflow, CNNs and OpenCV opertaions
are used to accomplish the objective . The model is trained 
and tested with the help of an open source MRLEye dataset.
An alarm is generated when a person or the driver take longer than 
the usual to open the eyes.
